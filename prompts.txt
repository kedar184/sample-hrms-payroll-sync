I want to integrate my HR system with my payroll system. 
@https://developers.datacomdirectaccess.co.nz/api/documentation/  this is the public API documentation for the payroll system.
It is used to generate payroll for my company's new zealand employees. i have a HR management system that is master for employee and absence records. 
The HR system produces change records in the form of a simple JSON payload when a employee record changes and when absence is logged by a user. It also offers REST API's to retrieve further details of the records. 
I want to sync this data to my payroll system. The payroll system finally runs pay on a set day and makes data available related to the pay. 
I dont have the specs for the HR management system so i want you to make some assumptions with the data model so it can be a cannonical model in future. 
I also want you to incorporate all the best practices from our starter project that we built. 
The tech stack will continue to be springboot. We will also continue to use GCP - pubsub for hr events with push subscription to service deployed on cloudrun. We will also use cloud build for CI and CD driven by the config-sync repository.

The pubsub event will be a generic event that has attributes for event type that will help us determine the routing. 
Aslo assume the event itself is more like a CDC event that tells what is the type, what record changed with the record identifier. 
This record identifier will help us query the HR system for more attributes using the REST API provided by the HR system.

Given that we dont have our HRMS system live implementation yet, can we create a mock to simulate the endpoints. 
I want the mocks to be running as part of the same service. We can later use the same mocks for integration tests. 
I want the ability to turn on the mock endpoints based on a flag in our application properties file. 

The mocks looks good for a starting point. We want to do same with datacom api's. 
Can you generate simillar mocks for the relevant endpoints ? Make sure you look at api documentation i provided earlier.

Looks good for now. Lets focus on the data mapping between the 2 systems and the api call implementation. 
Can you generate the mapping ? Assume its simple transforms as a starting point ? 
We want to handle following scenarios as a starting point for different types of events, consider checking whether its a NZ employee in all scenraios- 
1) New employee onboarded 
2) Employee role change 
3) Apply for leave
4) Apply for backdated leave 
5) Employee termination 

Have you considered using a library like mapstruct or modelmapper for the data transformation ? 
do u think that can simplify or it adds more complexity considering our use case ?

ok makes sense. lets go with builder pattern. Implement it. 
Also assume the check for NZ is based on a single attribute of the employee payload and not complex logic. We will cange the name of attribute once we have the spec

Lets focus a bit on authentication now. I see that you have used a API key. Based on documentation do we need a access token ? 
if so, implement it with a simple cache mechanism (no redis etc) and a check for expiry. 
I also want the secrets (API key) to be stored in  GCP secrets manager. assume a naming convention that includes secrets/integration/services. We will work out IAM permissions later

should we update our mock service to handle access token and have a stub for that ?

Lets work on secret handling for our HR system API's. Assume its simple API key based auth with same mechanisms for secret handling - i.e. secrets manager. 
Can you implement everything that is needed ?

Remember, this service is triggered using a push subscription in pubsub and we are not using a pull subscription. 
So can u modify accordingly and add a endpoiint to controller such that can acept a message from pubsub make sure the format matches

change the @RequestMapping and @PostMapping in pubsub controller to something meaningful while this is not really a rest implementation
lets use somthing like hrms/events

We may need to change the processEmployeeEvent() to have conditional logic to handle create/update since the pubsub controller only routes to processEmployeeEvent or processAbsenceEvent now. 
Make required changes for all scenarios.

lets add some resilliancy to our api calls ? is resilliance4j still the best option ? it should take care of simple retry scenarios with http calls
Also add some appropriate error handling based on pubsub push subscription error codes. 

Ok i think i am reasonably happy with the base service now. Lets focus on the tests before we move on to observability and error handling. 
Can you generate tests based on scenarios i had given earlier and maybe one for authentication ?

ok makes sense. some tests are not fully generated maybe you ran out of tokens can you complete them ?
@PayrollSyncServiceTest.java @PayrollSyncIntegrationTest.java @DatacomAuthServiceTest.java 

Looks good for now, will come back to it later. Lets  focus on observibility now starting with logging and tracing first. 
I want to use google cloud trace and  Opentelemetry based implementation. 

Have u considered MDC context ? can we add record id and record type from our event to our log context ? 
Also, i want to make sure payload logs can be enabled based on log levels.
Trace span should be created for each HTTP call. Consider avoiding duplicate boilerplate code and if can be part of client classes.
We can leave default settings for sampling.

Can you explain how the "around" annotation works and how is the bean injected during the api calls ?

Cool makes sense its using AOP with aspect annotation. Lets test this after deployment. 
Let us now add some base metrics. i want to track a few metrics - employees onboarded, terminated etc and the success/failure rate of those events. 
Can you add these metrics in the implementation ?

Metrics is adding a lot of noise to code and maybe effects a bit of readability. 
can u think of some ways to optimize this ? 
if we cant optimize much i am thinking just tracking bare min - number of transactions processed with success/failure

looks good i cant see the monitoring.md file u created. 
also remember i am using google cloud monitoring which i believe has promql support but i dont have grafana would like to use native capabilities of cloud monitoring.

we want to distinguish between business errors and technical errors. 
The business errors which are due to data issues (based on error codes from our datacom API) would need a notification sent out to users.
In such cases, the return code to pubsub should be 200 since we have now gracefully handled the errors.
We would also push a message by populating relevant details along with our service name etc to a seperate pubsub topic for business notifications.

Code is still complex for a simple feature. try to simplify it further. 
the bare minimum requirement is that we need a simple json payload that can be sent to a pubsub topic. 
Log.error should be still retained but in case of specific error types such as 400 (or based on specific API implementation). 
Lets make the necessary changes.

now lets add some code for sending out the business notification to a pubsub topic

looking at the cloudbuild file, build is using java17 can we use 21 and can u check if there would be any compatibility issues
we have used gradle:8.5-jdk21 instead of temurin. what is the widely adopted and recommended base image ? 
Also we have used buildpacks now instead of standard docker file. is that widely accepted as best practice now ?

i think we need the right libraries for pubsub. could it be because of java and spring boot compatibility issues. should we downgrade ?

if (log.isDebugEnabled()) { why is this line required, lt should be just based on log levels

if u have a look all test files are in src/test/java and not src/main/java already. 
some of the errors may be related to junit/mockito imports can u go through all test classes and add any missing import statements ?

api key handling error in hr client.  this should follow the same pattern as datacom 
only difference is its simple API key based authentication
datacom client uses restTemplate.postForObject vs HR client is using HttpMethod.GET in rest template. 
make it standard based on best practice

jpa:
    hibernate:
      ddl-auto: update
    show-sql: true
why do we have jpa config in our application when we are not dealing with state

rewrite all service tests since we have made some changes. 
I have deleted some test classes that are no longer needed.

add a gitgnore file
since we are using buildpacks delete the docker file. should be good ?
add a readme file that explains this project with a sequence diagram and use cases. explain the design, cloud native components used

ok can u create some curl commands so i can test for different scenraios by running the service locally. 
maybe just create them in a simple file so it can be used later

change the script so that it prints the api response with code as well

alright we have a clean build and local tests done lets get ready to ship it. Lets focus on gcp related aspects for all this to work. 
Lets first do it using gcloud commands before we move on to terraform and add it to our infra repo. 
Can u come up with steps for verifcation and execution considering - permissions for all resources, resources that need to be created (e.g. secrets) etc.

Put this steps in a file called gcp-sandbox.sh so we can work through it

Ok the service account is primarily for the microservice that would run on cloud run. Lets keep that in mind. 
First consider the secret creation in the script. Look at the apiclient classes and see if the secret paths match while we are creating the secrets. 
we are using secrets/integration/services. Fix appropriately

modify the script use local environment variables for initial setting of the secrets. while we dont have any actual secrets yet it would ensure there are no secrets in script.

datacom has 2 secrets right - client id and client secret that is used by datacomauthservice class

gcloud pubsub subscriptions create hr-events-sub \
    --topic hr-events \
    --ack-deadline=30
This looks like a pull subscription which is not what we want. 
we will create this step in a seperate script since it needs the actual cloudrun endpoint to be able to create that subscription. 
We can run cloudbuild and once cloudrun id deployed, we could create that as a second step. Can you action it ?

i have renamed application-cloud.yml to application-sandbox.yml. Can u change cloudbuild accordingly so this is picked up as active profile?
